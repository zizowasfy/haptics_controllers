{{PLEASE DO THIS BEFORE TRYING TO BUILD REAL-TIME KERNEL v5.9.1 (RTkernel) ON UBUNTU 20.04 to save yourself some time -- 1/2 hr:

1) Install these packages before building the RTkernel:

sudo apt install flex

sudo apt install bison

sudo apt install libncurses-dev

sudo apt install libelf-dev

sudo apt install dwarves

sudo apt install zstd

2) Remove the following libraries from the root directory of the kernel sources (Don't change the dir) every time you try to rebuild 

rm vmlinux-gdb.py

* This is to log the errors in a txt file for easier searching for the error after the Real-Time Kernel (RTkernel) build is completed:

make -j$(nproc) deb-pkg 2> error.txt
